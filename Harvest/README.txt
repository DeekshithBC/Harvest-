This is a sample project which shows how to use the HarvestDirectory target
provided by WiX:

http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/msbuild/target_reference/harvestdirectory.html

WiX is a tool for generating installers for Windows.

The HarvestDirectory target is useful because it allows you to include many files
in your installer without having to manually write XML tags for each of them.
However, it is a bit tricky to use.  I made this small project so that I could
experiment with it.
